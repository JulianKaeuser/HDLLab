\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}

In this chapter, the designed micro-architecture is presented. Achievements from verification (both RTL and gate level) are shown. Additionally, a view on the synthesis process and results is taken.

Our design implements the Thumb architecture almost completely. It is capable of executing all instructions except \texttt{CBZ} and \texttt{CBNZ}, and all instruction related to \texttt{HINT} and \texttt{STATE CHANGE} (the last two types are explicitly not required and at least \texttt{STATE CHANGE} cannot be implemented without an ARM-capable micro-architecture). We focused on implementing all instructions, since we interpreted this as a primary objective from the lab manual. With these instructions, our processor is capable of executing both the \texttt{count32} and the \texttt{memcp46} benchmark applications.
