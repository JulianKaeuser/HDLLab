\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}

In this chapter, the designed micro-architecture are be presented. Achievements from verification (both RTL and gate levelare shown. Additionally, a view on the synthesis process and results is taken.

Our design implements the Thumb2-architecture almost completely. It is capable of executing all instructions except the \texttt{CMPZ} and \texttt{CMPNZ}, and \texttt{HINT} and \texttt{STATE CHANGE} (the last two types are explicitly not required and at least \texttt{STATE CHANGE} acnnot be implemented without an ARM-capable micro-architecture). We focused on implementing all instructions, since we interpreted the lab manual in this way. With these instructions, our processor is capable of executing both the \texttt{count32} and the \texttt{memcp46} benchmark applications.
