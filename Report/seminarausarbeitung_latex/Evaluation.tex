\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}

here some stuff on how good this processor is

- what could be better:
  - IT-instruction in fetch
  - better memory controller -lacks time
  - ALU with better solution for multiply (not single cycle)
  - decoder frees fetch earlier
  - 
  
  - process:
    -first benchmarks, then the rest
    -better look at rewuirements
    -better overview on what should happen
    
- conclusion:
  - very much work, lack of time
  - trotzdem instruction set working
  - have a more detailed look on requirements, e.g. byte-alignment
  -
